Today, was a mark of my successful first attempt of using Jekyll.

Today, I missed my class due to a cancelled train and lost my umbrella in a windy rainy day, but I also met two amazing leaders at the UNDP and had my favorite Thai food, pad kee mao. It's surely been a pretty long day for me, but in between, I was very so curious on learning to build a Jekyll site.

Many experts and professionals in academia and industries migrated to this template from their old Wordpress or Ghost site since Jekyll provides coders with a clean static template and harnesses the power of markdown, "which makes writing HTML much easier and more efficient". For anyone who's interested in learning to build one too, I'd highly recommend this [tutorial](https://www.taniarascia.com/make-a-static-website-with-jekyll/) to follow. It's totally worth spending a few hours on!

Though I'm on Jekyll now to produce more work-oriented, data-related projects, I'll still be writing on [Medium](https://medium.com/@moorissa) for fun and as an editor for [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science). Follow me on my journey as I'll keep my Data Lab site updated with all exciting projects about machine learning, visualizations, and exploratory analysis.
